Measures for prevention
 Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.

 When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating. 

Measures for Self-Isolation in Case of Developing Symptoms or Being Tested Positive
 Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.

 Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider’s recommendation. However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.

 If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:

 -  If a person is in self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention)

 have a large, well-ventilated with hand-hygiene and toilet facilities
 If this is not possible, place beds at least 1 metre apart
 Keep at least 1 metre from others, even from your family members
 Isolate for 14 days, even if you feel healthy
 Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.

Medications for treating Covid-19
 To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the new Coronavirus. Specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials.
 However, micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.
 Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, a treatment for malaria, lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis, has been under study as a possible treatment for COVID-19. Current data shows that this drug does not reduce deaths among hospitalised COVID-19 patients, nor help people with moderate disease.*

 The use of hydoxychloroquine and chloroquine is accepted as generally safe for patients with malaria and autoimmune diseases, but its use where not indicated and without medical supervision can cause serious side effects and should be avoided.

 * More decisive research is needed to assess its value in patients with mild disease or as pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis in patients exposed to COVID-19.



Develpment in the Vaccines
  When candidate vaccines make it to human clinical trials, they first go through phase 1 trials primarily to test the vaccine’s safety, determine dosages and identify any potential side effects in a small number of people. Phase 2 trials further explore safety and start to investigate efficacy in larger groups. The final stage, phase 3 trials, which few vaccines ever make it to, involve thousands or tens of thousands of people, and aim to confirm and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine and identify any rare side effects which only show up in large groups. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists vaccine candidates at various stages of clinical trials. Here is a slightly more detailed look at those vaccines that have made it to phase 1 and beyond, based on publicly available information.
